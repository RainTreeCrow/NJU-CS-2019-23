# SnakeProject
The classical FPGA game where the snake grows as it eats and the game ends when the snake collides to the wall or to itself. The project was implemented using Verilog and must be downloaded to the DE1-SoC board to run. The verilog code for the project is called snake.v. The VGA modules are provided by the University of Toronto Electrical & Computer Engineering department.

The game has additional features such as additional obstacles, speed changing and teleport tunnels, check it out!
